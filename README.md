# nuclei-detection

This project is my solution to the 2018 Data Science Bowl held in Kaggle. This was my first competition in Kaggle. I started the competition quite late, when there were only 9 days to finish. Therefore I only had time to build a very simple CNN and I finished in position 638 out of 3634 (top 18%).
